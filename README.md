A synthesis approach to design of relations given a set of FDs


# Todos
- [x] Attribute closure 
- [x] Armstrong: ir2, ir3, ir5
- [x] Check two Functional Dependency (FD) set is equivalent
- [x] Find closure Functional Dependency set (FDs) from Armstrong rule set
- [x] Minimal cover of FDs
- [ ] Find key from FDs
- [ ] Check collection of attribute is key of relation 
- [ ] Check current Normal Form of relation
- [ ] Decompose relation to 3NF from FDs
- [ ] Decompose relation to BCNF from FDs
- [ ] Test Nonadditive Join Property after decomposition relation
